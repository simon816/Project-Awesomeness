Project Awesomeness
---

This was a project that I worked on in 2014 to have fun with networked neighbouring computers.

Features:

- A "beam" coming from the centre of the screen shoots off to the edge, where it is met by a beam on the neighbouring computer screen. This demonstrates how the computers are "connected".
- A circle that can be fired from the server controller that travels across all computers from right to left.
- A red rectangle that has a 50% chance of jumping to the left or to the right.
- Scrolling text
- Set all clients to show a given color.
- A simple pong game where the leftmost and rightmost computers have control of the paddles.
